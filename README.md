## How to Play
To get started, select your location on the map, or press Find Me to automatically get your location. Then select the size of your bingo card by clicking on the birds below the map. Finally, click Play to start a new game. Cards are rearranged with new birds every night so check back tomorrow for a new game.

Click or tap on the birds to check them off as you see them during your day. If you check off a full row, column or diagonal, you win! You then have the option to keep checking off birds on that card or to start a new card. You can click the info button in the bottom right corner of each image to view the photographer credit.

## How it Works
Bird Bingo uses the North American Bird Conservation Initiative regions to divide North America into areas of similar ecological characteristics. Bird observation data available at eBird.com by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology is used to determine the most common birds in each region for the current season. Each bingo card is populated with a mix of the most common birds and a random selection of rarer birds from that region. You can click the Show Regions button to see the regions on the map. Bird photos are supplied by the Macaulay Library.
